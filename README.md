# Psychic-Game

The Psychic Game is a basic javascript introduction game.

To play press a letter on the keyboard and try and guess what the computer has randomly selected. You have 9 trys per turn to beat the computer. If you guess correctly within the 9 trys you win, and will see a +1 added to the wins row. If you do not guess correctly, a loss will be added to the losses row. You can keep track of what letters you have used by looking at the list of your guesses.

Good luck.
